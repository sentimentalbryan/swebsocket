For a local test server, I use bottle-websocket and websocket-client python packages.

```
sudo pip install bottle-websocket
sudo pip install websocket-client
```

They can be found in the resources directory.

A test client to verify everything is working ok

websocket_client.py

A test server for use when running integration tests.

websocket_example.py
